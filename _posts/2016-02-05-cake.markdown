<p>Studying philosophy of technology, phenomenology of the internet, and digital policy has enabled me to apply theory into practice while working on professional and personal projects. Iâ€™m constantly striving to find a balance between practical knowledge and theoretical understanding. I enjoy reading books on philosophy and design, as well as taking online courses to improve and master my skills using digital tools. </p>
